# Pet Bloom

## About
This app solves the problem of unreliable information of pets shown on google search. Attractions including restaurants identified as pet friendly are however, no longer pet friendly. Pet owners often end up ruining their day because some places refuse to provide service. And it is not easy for them to find another place. Our app is called Pet Bloom and is similar in concept to the Pikmin Bloom game but instead we have pet-owners be able to leave reviews of pet-related places they have been to previously and be able to share their knowledge with other users. During the walk, users can get notifications on nearby pet-friendly places, alongside with the reviews and images left by themselves or others. Our app would allow users to share their moments with their pets on their blogs and track information about their pets. The app would provide statistics of all the information in graphs, to help users monitor their weekly activities.
